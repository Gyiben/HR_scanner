# HR Scanner

## The Idea:
I wanted to create a design fiction prototype that feels like a real corporate tool, but also clearly shows the problems of using algorithms to judge people. 

I imagined a company that uses an “HR Scanner” to read casual social media posts from job applicants and predict if they will do a workplace violation in the future.

 The goal of the prototype is not to build a perfect prediction system, but to make people think about how unfair and risky this kind of idea is in the real world.

## The Concept:
Imagine a world where your late-night tweets, sarcastic memes, or weekend photos are fed into a black-box algorithm to determine your professional worth. HR Scanner brings this terrifying concept to life.

The tool presents a similar corporate dashboard that hides a deeply flawed premise: that we can predict a person's future behavior using their digital exhaust.

## Core Themes Explored:
Context collapse: How algorithms fail to understand sarcasm, inside jokes, or cultural nuances.

Preemptive punishment: The "Minority Report" effect of being denied employment for something you might do.

The illusion of objectivity: How presenting biased, arbitrary data through clean UI and percentage scores makes it feel like "science."
